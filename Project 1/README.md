# Singly Linked List Based Queue

Basic queue derived from singly linked list. An enqueue() uses the push_back() function of the list class and dequeue() uses the pop_front() function of the list class. Both of these tests have a time complexity of O(1). The test programs in the ‘tests’ and ‘matlab’ folder contain tests to compare our class to the standard libraries queue.
